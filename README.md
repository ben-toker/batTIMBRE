# Dependencies and MATLAB
Due to the differing dependency builds and MATLAB versions of the bat dataset and TIMBRE architecture, there were many issues with handling older
MATLAB files (in the rat dataset wth scipy.io) and newer (using hdf5storage) at the same time. Since the two datasets don't have to directly talk to eachother
and we simply need to import them into one location, this was resolved by using the latest version of numpy that essentially didn't break hdf5storage (in version 2.0.0, released on June 16th,2024, a critical component to the functionality of hdf5storage broke. Reverting to numpy version 1.26.4 solved the issue.)
